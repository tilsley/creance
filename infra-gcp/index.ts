/**
 * agent-os GCP plumbing — the "managed Agent Runtime" profile (ADR-0042's GCP sibling).
 *
 * Phase 1 ("Loop on Agent Runtime") needs only the durable resources AROUND the loop:
 *   - an Artifact Registry repo to hold the agent-runtime image (the loop container),
 *   - the service-account identity the managed Runtime session assumes.
 * The Agent Runtime deploy itself is imperative (client.agent_engines.create with a
 * container_spec.image_uri) — there is no clean IaC resource for it yet, the one
 * sanctioned exception to "provision through IaC, never ad-hoc create".
 *
 * FUTURE REFACTOR: fold this and the AWS CDK stack under infra/gcp + infra/aws for
 * symmetry (per the layout discussion). infra-gcp/ is the interim home.
