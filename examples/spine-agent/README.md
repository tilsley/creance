# spine-agent — the platform's smallest end-to-end test

The first **real agent** run through the whole platform (not curl): a `runAgent` loop that
thinks once, through the governed gateway, and returns.

```
runAgent (L1 loop)  →  OpenAIGatewayInferenceProvider (M4)  →  LiteLLM gateway  →  Bedrock
   holds NO model creds        forwards the agent's identity     authn + budget      Haiku
```

```bash
make spine-agent        # or: bash examples/spine-agent/run.sh "your question"
```

Proven: `status=completed`, the answer comes back, and the telemetry shows
`inference=openai-gateway` — i.e. the model call left the runtime, went through the gateway
(which authenticated `bob`, checked the claim/budget, and called Bedrock with *its* creds), and
the agent never touched a model credential. Spend is trivial (Haiku, ~$0.00003/turn) and settles
to the `agent-os-budgets` counter.

**What it exercises:** L1 loop · the M4 OpenAI-wire gateway adapter · M2 verified-identity authn ·
M1 worst-case budget admission · guard (noop here) · record (console). Think-only (`tools: () => []`)
so it isolates the spine; the research / budget-buster / code agents layer `do` and the 402 on top.

## In k3s — the full spine, real Kubernetes identity (`k8s-pod.yaml`)

`k8s-pod.yaml` runs the spine **as a pod** with a **projected ServiceAccount token** (audience
`agent-os-gateway`) — no model creds, no auth code. It calls the in-cluster `inference-gateway`
(deployed by [`charts/inference-gateway`](../../charts/inference-gateway)), which verifies the token
via the **cluster API (TokenReview)**, derives the tenant from the claim binding, checks the
claim/budget, and calls Bedrock. Validated end to end on colima/k3s: `status=completed`, output `Paris`.

```bash
# gateway up (real SA tokens + a claim for the agent's SA) + creds for Bedrock:
make k8s-creds   # but into agentos-gw; see the spine k8s notes
helm install inference-gateway charts/inference-gateway -n agentos-gw --create-namespace \
  --set env.CLAIM_SOURCE=static \
  --set-string 'env.CLAIMS_STATIC={"system:serviceaccount:agentos-gw:spine-agent":{"model":"eu.anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-20251001-v1:0","monthlyBudgetUsd":5}}'
kubectl apply -n agentos-gw -f examples/spine-agent/k8s-pod.yaml
kubectl -n agentos-gw logs spine-agent
```

The agent presents an identity it never had to *verify*; the gateway does all the auth — and the
agent's own code (and process) carries none of it. Without a mesh, the gateway self-verifies via
JWKS (cheap mode); with Istio/Linkerd it'd trust a mesh-forwarded identity instead (full mode).

### Full mode — Linkerd, the agent carries NO token (`k8s-pod-mesh.yaml`)

Validated locally: with `agentos-gw` meshed and the gateway in `MESH_IDENTITY_HEADER=l5d-client-id`
mode, `k8s-pod-mesh.yaml` runs the agent with **no token and no projected-token volume** — a plain
call. Linkerd mTLS-authenticates it; the gateway maps `l5d-client-id` → the same tenant the JWKS
path used → `status=completed`, output `Paris.`. The agent process is fully identity-unaware. Setup
+ gotchas: [`deploy/local/linkerd.md`](../../deploy/local/linkerd.md). Same `Authenticator` port — no
agent or gateway *code* change, just env (`JWT_JWKS_URL` ↔ `MESH_IDENTITY_HEADER`).
